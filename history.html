	<p>The Bills began competitive play in 1960 as a charter member of the <a href="">American Football League</a> led by head coach Buster Ramsey and joined the NFL as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL%E2%80%93NFL_merger">AFL–NFL merger</a> in 1970.[7] The Bills won two consecutive American Football League titles in 1964 and 1965, but the club has yet to win a league championship since.</p>
	
	<p>Once the AFL–NFL merger took effect, the Bills became the second NFL team to represent the city; they followed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_(NFL)">Buffalo All-Americans</a>, a charter member of the league. Buffalo had been left out of the league since the All-Americans (by that point renamed the Bisons) folded in 1929; the Bills were no less than the third professional non-NFL team to compete in the city before the merger, following the Indians/Tigers of the early 1940s and an earlier team named the Bills, originally the Bisons, in the late 1940s in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-America_Football_Conference">All-America Football Conference</a> (AAFC).</p>
	
	<p>In 1947 a contest was held to rename the Bisons, which was owned by James Breuil of the Frontier Oil Company. The winning entry suggested Bills, reflecting on the famous western frontiersman, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bill">Buffalo Bill Cody</a>. Carrying the "frontier" theme further, the winning contestant offered the team was being supported by Frontier Oil and was "opening a new frontier in sports in Western New York." When Buffalo joined the new American Football League in 1960, the name of the city's earlier pro football entry was adopted.[8]</p>
	
	<p>After being pushed to the brink of failure in the mid-1980s, the collapse of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Football_League">United States Football League</a> and a series of high draft picks allowed the Bills to rebuild into a perennial contender in the late 1980s through the mid-1990s, a period in which the team won four consecutive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Championship_Game">AFC Championships</a>; the team nevertheless lost all four subsequent Super Bowls, records in both categories that still stand.</p>
	
	<p>The rise of the division rival <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots">New England Patriots</a> under Tom Brady, along with numerous failed attempts at rebuilding in the 2000s and 2010s, have prevented the Bills from reaching the playoffs since 1999, a 17-year drought that is the longest active playoff drought in all major professional sports. On October 8, 2014, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Sabres">Buffalo Sabres</a> owners Terry and Kim Pegula received unanimous approval to acquire the Bills during the NFL owners' meetings, becoming the second ownership group of the team after team founder Ralph Wilson.[9]</p>
