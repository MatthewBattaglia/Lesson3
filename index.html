		<main><p>The <strong>Buffalo Bills</strong> are a professional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football">American football</a> team based in the Buffalo–Niagara Falls metropolitan area. The Bills compete in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League">National Football League</a> (NFL), as a member club of the league's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_Conference">American Football Conference</a> (AFC) East division. The team plays their home games at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Era_Field">New Era Field</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchard_Park_(town),_New_York">Orchard Park, New York</a>. The Bills are the only NFL team that plays its home games in the state of New York (the New York Giants and New York Jets play at MetLife Stadium, located in East Rutherford, New Jersey). The Bills conduct summer training camp at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._John_Fisher_College">St. John Fisher College</a> in <em>Pittsford, New York</em>, an eastern suburb of <em>Rochester, New York.[4]</em></p></main>
	

	<p>The Bills began play as an original franchise of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_League">American Football League</a> (AFL) in 1960. The club joined the NFL as a result of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL%E2%80%93NFL_merger">AFL–NFL merger</a> for the 1970 season. The 1964 and 1965 Bills were the only teams representing Buffalo that won major league professional sports championships ("back-to-back" American Football League Championships). The Bills are the only team to win four consecutive conference championships and are the only NFL team to lose four consecutive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl">Super Bowl</a> games. The team was owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Wilson">Ralph Wilson</a> from the team's founding in 1960, until his death in 2014 at the age of 95. After his death, Wilson's estate reached an agreement to sell the team to Terry and Kim Pegula, which was approved by the other NFL team owners on October 8, 2014.[5] The Bills have the longest active playoff drought in any major professional sport: they have not qualified to play in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs">NFL playoffs</a> since 1999 and are the only team that has not appeared in the playoffs so far in the 21st century.[6]</p>
